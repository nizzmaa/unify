### Project Description
Our project is a centralized campus communication platform that connects students and faculty within and across colleges to share notes, post academic updates, collaborate on projects, and engage in structured discussions. It enhances and organizes peer learning and event discovery prioritizing nearby colleges while reducing fragmented communication across multiple platforms.
### The Problem statement
Campus communication is scattered across multiple platforms, making it hard for students to find events, notes, and collaborators in one place.

### The Solution
Our platform solves this by providing a centralized, organized system for academic communication within and across colleges.

*This flowchart illustrates the workflow of the inter/intra-college communication platform. Users first log in through the User Login Page and are directed to their User Profile (dashboard). From the dashboard, users can access various modules such as Events, Peer Groups, Tutoring & Notes, Projects, and Common Library. Each module enables students to participate in academic and collaborative activities, including viewing events, joining study groups, sharing knowledge, submitting project ideas, and accessing shared resources, thereby promoting effective communication and learning across colleges.*
